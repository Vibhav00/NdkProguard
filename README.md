# Native Development Kit (NDK) and R8 with ProGuard

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Native Development Kit (NDK) along with R8 and ProGuard in Android development. These tools are used for enhancing application performance and security by utilizing native code and applying obfuscation techniques to protect against reverse engineering.

## Native Development Kit (NDK)
The Native Development Kit (NDK) allows Android developers to implement parts of their app in native languages like C or C++. Using the NDK, developers can achieve:

- **Improved Performance:** Access to low-level APIs and system resources.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Reuse of existing C/C++ libraries.
- **Security Benefits:** Native code is often more challenging to reverse-engineer than Java code.

### Key Features
- **Access to Native Libraries:** Enables the use of C and C++ libraries.
- **Integration with Android Studio:** Includes tools to build and debug native code.
- **JNI Support:** Uses Java Native Interface (JNI) to call native code from Java/Kotlin.

## R8 and ProGuard
R8 is an optimization and obfuscation tool for Android, intended as a replacement for ProGuard. It reduces APK size, improves performance, and provides code obfuscation to protect your app from reverse engineering.

### Key Features of R8
- **Code Shrinking:** Removes unused code and resources.
- **Optimization:** Enhances code performance through various optimizations.
- **Obfuscation:** Obscures code to make it harder to decompile.
- **Desugaring:** Supports new language features and reduces method count.

### Key Features of ProGuard
- **Code Obfuscation:** Changes class, field, and method names to make the app harder to reverse-engineer.
- **Code Optimization:** Reduces APK size and removes unused code.
- **Support for Older Versions:** ProGuard has been around for a long time and is widely used.

## Why Use R8 and ProGuard with NDK?
While native code can be more secure than Java or Kotlin, using R8 and ProGuard in combination with the NDK adds another layer of protection. Obfuscating Java/Kotlin code and hiding native method calls can make it much harder for attackers to understand and reverse-engineer your app.

## Getting Started
To use the NDK, R8, and ProGuard in your Android project:

1. **Enable NDK Support:**
   - Add NDK dependencies to your project in the `build.gradle` file:
     ```groovy
     android {
         defaultConfig {
             ndk {
                 abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Enable R8 and ProGuard:**
   - R8 is enabled by default for release builds in Android Studio. To configure ProGuard rules, add a `proguard-rules.pro` file in the projectâ€™s root directory.
   - Customize your ProGuard rules to exclude specific classes or methods from obfuscation as necessary.

3. **Build and Test:**
   - Use the Android Studio build tools to build your project, ensuring that both native libraries and obfuscation settings are correctly applied.

## Example ProGuard Rules
```proguard
# Keep Native Libraries
-keep class com.example.native.** { *; }

# Keep JNI methods
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    native <methods>;
}

# Do not obfuscate any C/C++ related classes
-keep class **.R
